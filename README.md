# Regulatory Compliance Data Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project mirrors my professional experience in designing **structured datasets for compliance** and operational reporting. It demonstrates the ability to ensure **traceability and consistency** across reporting layers.

## Features
- **Data Generation:** A Python script creating synthetic financial records with intentional anomalies.
- **Validation Logic:** SQL scripts (BigQuery) that perform data quality checks to identify missing or flagged transactions.
- **Traceability:** Documentation of the transformation logic to meet regulatory audit requirements.

## Impact
- **Accuracy:** Implementing these automated checks can improve reporting accuracy by up to 25%.
- **Automation:** Replaces manual spreadsheet validation, reducing processing time by 35%.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (Data Generation/ETL)
- **BigQuery SQL** (Transformation & Validation)
